You must set the mandatory parameters. Available options (* indicates a mandatory option):
  -v <int>
     * SSR version.
  -p <file path>
     * Path to the parameter file.
  -i <file path>
     * Path to the training file.
  -I <file path>
     Path to the test file (optional).
  -T <file path>
     * Path to the test file (optional).
  -o <file path>
     Path to the output files.
  -s <file path>
     Path to a file with a list of seeds to use during iterations.
  -a <prefix string>
     Identifier prefix for files.
  -t <int>
     Number of threads (for parallel execution).  -g <int>
     Maximum number of iterations (default = 10).
  -n <int>
     Number of repetitions of the algorithm (default = 1).
  -k <int>
     Number of folds (cross-validation).
  -b <double>
     If the value is in [0,1], defines percentage used for test in holdout validation.
     If the value is bigger than 1, defines absolute quatity used for test in holdout validation.
  -e <int>
     Minimun error to compute a hit (default = 0.0).
  -ss <int>
     Strip size for version 10.
  -nf <int>
     Number of folds for version 10.
  -C
     Uses splited data from files for cross-validation. Use a path to the files in the form
     /pathToFile/repeatedName#repeatedName, where # indicates where the fold index is placed
     (a number from 0 to k-1), e.g. /home/iris-#.dat, with 3 folds in the path will look for
     iris-0.dat, iris-1.dat and iris-2.dat
  -B
     Uses sampled data from files for holdout. Use a path to the files in the form
     /pathToFile/repeatedName#repeatedName, where # is composed by the pattern      (train|test)-i with i=0,1,...,n-1, where n is the number of experiment files,
     e.g. /home/iris-#.dat, with 4 files (2x(train+test)) in the path will look for
     iris-train-0.dat, iris-test-0.dat, iris-train-1.dat and iris-test-0.dat
  -u
    Uses unshuffled data.
